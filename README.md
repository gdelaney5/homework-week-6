Week 6 Homework - Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard application which allows you to search for weather in any city.

Simply enter in the name of the city you would like to view, and then click 'Search'

A Search will bring up the current weather conditions in the city that you have entered.  It will also render a 5 day weather forecast for that city.

Upon searching for a new city, the previous entry you searched for should be displayed below the search bar as a button which can be clicked on for retrieval of that city's information.
